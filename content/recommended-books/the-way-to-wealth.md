{{< heading "The Way to Wealth" "Benjamin Franklin" >}}

_The Way to Wealth_ is not only my favorite personal finance book, but also one
my favorite books in general. Easily read in one sitting, it's an invaluable
source of wisdom for both personal finance _and_ how to live a happy,
prosperous life. As long as you can get past the old-fashioned language and the
barrage of proverbs, this book is full of gems.

## Setting

A little background: Ben Franklin published a yearly almanac from 1732 - 1758
called _Poor Richard's Almanack_. In this almanac, he had many adages and
proverbs scattered about. Then in 1758, he published _The Way to Wealth_, which
is essentially a collection of those adages and proverbs.

The book's delivery is a bit unqiue. Ben Franklin stops by a gathering of
people near an auction that hasn't started yet. The crowd complains about
excessive taxes to a man named Father Abraham, who then proceeds to preach to
the crowd (for the rest of the book) using the proverbs from _Poor Richard's
Almanack_.

## Main Takeaway

The main takeaway is an idea we see over and over again in personal finance.
This idea is twofold:
1. Make the most of your _**time**_. (Time is finite and precious. Use it as best you can.)
2. Make the most of your _**money**_. (_Earn_ as much money as you can; only _spend_ money on necessary expenses).

From such a dense book of proverbs, it is difficult to pick only a few
favorites. However, I believe the three I've selected below best convey the
theme of the book:

> Do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.

> Diligence is the mother of good luck.

> If you would be wealthy, think of saving as well as getting.

## Conclusion

I'd like to end with two more quotes from the book. I've saved them for now
because even though they don't _directly_ relate to the theme, they are still
very powerful:

> A word to the wise is enough.

> Those that cannot be counseled, cannot be helped.

This book might seem silly at first, and it might even be difficult to read
because of the old-fashioned language, the tone, etc. However, it would be
unfortunate to allow anything like that to stand between you and your way to
wealth.

## Get The Book

This book is _highly_ accessible.  There are several versions available on
Amazon (all for a dollar or less on Kindle), and it's even available elsewhere
as [a free
PDF.](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/texts/1758%20Franklin%20Wealth.pdf)

However, having read 4 or 5 versions, the one I recommend most is the Best
Success Books version (which is available on Amazon).

Not only is the language easiest to read with this version, but it also
includes [_Advice to a Young
Tradesman_](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/texts/1748%20Franklin%20Advice.pdf)
(one of Ben Franklin's other works) and a great excerpt from his autobiography
regarding his well-known 13 virtues.
