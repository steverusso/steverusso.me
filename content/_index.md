I'm Steve.
I like personal finance and software engineering.

I'm lead developer (and so far lead writer) for [BigTech.fail](https://bigtech.fail/): a research project to highlight the dangers of censorship and misinformation from today's technology companies and governments.
I journal about things related to its architecture and development [here](/bigtechfail/).

I write reviews on some of my favorite books [here](/book-reviews/).
Check out my [GitHub](http://github.com/steverusso).
